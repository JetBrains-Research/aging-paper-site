    <h1>Multiomics dissection of healthy human aging</h1>
</div>
<h2>Experiment</h2>
<p>
    Aging is accompanied by alterations happening in the whole organism and within the individual cells.
    Our study aims to comprehensively characterize changes happening in the distinct human cell type and its environment
    during the process of healthy aging.
    <br>
    We have compared classical CD14+CD16- monocytes obtained from blood of two sex- and race-matched cohorts: 20 young
    individuals (25-30 years old) and 20 older people (60-70 years old) without any acute or chronic inflammatory
    conditions, no history of smoking, and with comparable body-mass indices.
    We comprehensively characterized the plasma and classical monocytes from both cohorts using proteomic and
    metabolomics profiling, RNA-Seq, RRBS (DNA methylation) and ULI-CHIP-seq for 5 major chromatin modifications
    (H3k27ac, H3k27me3, H3k36me3, H3k4me1, H3k4me3).
</p>
<p>
    Initial analysis revealed significant difference in metabolic and
    proteomic composition of plasma, DNA methylation levels of monocytes between two cohorts but no significant
    transcriptional difference. Strikingly, no changes in chromatin modifications was observed between two cohorts.
    However, integrative analysis
    revealed that specific chromatin patterns poise age associated DNA methylation changes, providing different
    positional clues to hyper- and hypo-methylation of DNA.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
    The comparative epigenetic study of this scale has never been undertaken previously in the context of human aging.
    <br>
    See <a href="methods.html">Methods</a> section for detailed protocols and computational pipelines used. Sections <strong>Explore
    Data</strong> and <strong>Download Data</strong> contain preconfigured genome browser
    session for instant visual analysis and download of the data.
</p>
<p>
    The peak calling routine presents significant challenge in working with large scale human epigenetic data,
    we developed a novel semi-supervised peak calling approach applicable to datasets of this scale.
    <br/>
    Along with pioneer dataset, we provide a completely <a href="tools.html">new integrative solution</a> for Chip-Seq
    analysis.

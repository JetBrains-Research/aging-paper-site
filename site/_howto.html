    <h1>Visual peak calling How-To</h1>
</div>
<p>Visual peak calling is a semi-supervised algorithm. At first we need to train SPAN models
    for each tracks locally or using computational cluster. Then visualize Chip-Seq signal
    tracks in JBR Genome Browser, load trained SPAN models and run peak calling tuning procedure.
</p>

<h2>Train Models</h2>
<p>TODO: show cmdline args and results output sample, SPAN model files locations</p>

<h2>Load Data Into JBR Genome Browser</h2>
<p>TODO: Create session using 2 *bw tracks from  http://artyomovlab.wustl.edu/, add links to
related SPAN models. User is supposed to download models, open them in JBR browser.</p>

<h2>Peak Calling</h2>
<p>TODO: Suggest to run tune action in JBR. Also describe how to change FDR, GAP and do
    peak calling manually.
</br>
    TODO: Labelling recommendations...
</br>
    TODO: Optionally suggest to open our labels and try peak calling tuning to view rescued tracks
</p>.

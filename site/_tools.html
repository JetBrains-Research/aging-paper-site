    <h1>Peak Calling Solution</h1>

<div id="description-block">
    <p>
        The peak calling routine presents significant challenge in working with large scale human epigenetic data:
        while ULI-ChipSeq protocol generally allows for robust peak calling, it is considerably more variable than
        classical
        ChipSeq approach. Accurately dissecting the situation when both background and the signal can vary is generally
        prohibitively complex task for the unbiased peak calling approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
        We propose the novel semi-supervised approach to peak calling.
        Fast and effective semi-supervised peaks analyzer <a href="span.html">SPAN Peak Analyzer</a> is a multipurpose peak calling capable
        processing both conventional and ULI-ChipSeq tracks.
        In the semi-supervised approach, user annotates a handful of locations as peaks, valleys or peak shores,
        and then uses these annotations to train the model that is optimal for a
        given sample.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the major challenges of the semi-supervised learning is the procedural complexity of the manual
        annotation of the data, which often leads to the inaccuracies and mix-ups. We created a brand new visualization
        tool
        that would support classical genome browser capabilities and provide readily accessible integrated peak
        annotation
        and peak calling capabilities.
        <a href="jbr.html">JBR Genome Browser</a>, allows one to upload tracks of the Chip-Seq data and perform on-the-fly annotation
        and peak calling for a given annotation, where results of the peak calling are immediately visualized as bed
        files
        in the same session. It can serve not only as efficient semi-supervised peak calling engine but also as next
        generation genome browser. It provides enhanced capabilities of viewing large files, observing multiple
        locations
        simultaneously and gathering track statistics.

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <a href="span.html">SPAN Peak Analyzer</a> and <a href="jbr.html">JBR Genome Browser</a> can be used separately as
    general purpose peak caller and genome browsers, however together they can serve as a
    complete solution for peak calling.
    Semi-supervised peak calling approach is capable improving peaks consistency in datasets with different
    signal-to-noise ratio,
    as well as obtaining best peak calling results for individual samples.

The peak calling routine presents significant challenge in working with large scale human epigenetic data:
while ULI-ChipSeq protocol generally allows for robust peak calling, it is considerably more variable than classical
ChipSeq approach. Accurately dissecting the situation when both background and the signal can vary is generally
prohibitively complex task for the unbiased peak calling approaches.
<br/>
To circumvent this, we propose the novel semi-supervised approach to peak calling.
Fast and effective semi-supervised peaks analyzer <b>SPAN peak caller</b> is a multipurpose peak calling capable
processing both conventional and ULI-ChipSeq tracks.
In the semi-supervised approach, user annotates a handful of locations as peaks, valleys or peak shores,
and then uses these annotations to train the model that is optimal for a
given sample. One of the major challenges of the semi-supervised learning is the
procedural complexity of the manual curation/annotation of the data, which often leads to the inaccuracies and
mix-ups.
Therefore, we set out to create a brand new visualization tool that would support classical genome browser
capabilities and provide readily accessible integrated peak annotation and peak calling capabilities.
The tool, named <b>JBR genome
    browser</b>, allows one to upload tracks of the ChipSeq data and perform on-the-fly annotation
and peak calling for a given annotation, where results of the peak calling are immediately visualized as bed files
in the same session. It can serve not only as efficient semi-supervised peak calling engine but also as next
generation genome browser.
It provides enhanced capabilities of viewing large files, observing multiple locations simultaneously and gathering
track statistics.

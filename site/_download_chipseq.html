Files included in this table:
<ul>
    <li>
        Reads - Raw reads in FASTQ format will be available upon request at <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap">dbGAP</a>.
        Each FASTQ track was aligned without multimappers on <a
            href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway?db=hg19">hg19</a> (GRCh37 Genome Reference Consortium Human
        Reference 37).<br>
        Alignment is available in BED.GZ format.
    </li>
    <li>
        QC - Libraries QC information by <a href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">fastqc</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        BigWigs - visualization of reads for each donor in BigWig format.
    </li>
    <li>
        Peaks - Peaks were obtained using novel semi-supervised peak calling <a href="tools.html">approach</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Visual Labels - Handful annotation of locations as peaks, valleys or peak shores, used to obtain peaks, that is optimal
        for a given sample.
    </li>
    <li>
        Peak Caller Models - Trained models for each sample, that <a href="howto.html">can</a> be used for visual peak calling with
        corresponding labels.
    </li>
</ul>
